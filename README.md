This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
This is configured to be a static site by default.

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Bug Fix

If the same site page routes are returning 404, add ".html" to end of the links. This can be done with a simple search via VS Code and changing the occurrences.
